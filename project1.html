<h3>Project Description.</h3>

<p>After visiting a post office inside a mall recently, I found it interesting how automated and portable the process of submitting mail was. This was so much so that one could even use a self-checkout machine to process mail. With that in mind, I assumed that the next step for the post office was to go even more portable, even mobile. This is where the idea of a mobile USPS office came from.</p>
