<p>Surveillance in our modern society appears to be a two-way system. Part of it is based on the observed knowing they are being watched and consciously navigating the world with this in mind. Someone is always there to keep things in line. Moving this idea over to a supermarket like Walmart, one can see this through how shoppers interact with the store. If it’s on display, it’s probably there for a reason. With this concept in mind, I chose to experiment by making a piece of display of my own.</p>

<p>Continuing with playing with the concept of surveillance and art, I decided to “exhibit” my display in other parts of the store. This is just a brief sample of when I placed the cart in the middle of one of the aisles in the automotive section of the store. Prior to this, 2 other attempts were made with minimal success in terms of interaction by shoppers. It should be worth noting, that it was about one hour after the cart remained in the aisle that it was finally removed.</p>
