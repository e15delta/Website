<h3>1. Inverted Trash Bin Lid</h3>

<p>- A public trash bin was spotted with its lid placed upside-down.</p>
<p>-Despite the lid covering the cavity of the bin, trash has still been placed into it.</p>
<p>-A sticker writing out KOLORCANS.COM is present on the lid.</p>
<p>-On the same lid, a seemingly broken chain hangs into the dome-shaped interior.</p>

<h3>2. Hollow Metal Gate</h3>

<p>- A metal gate with no fencing in between its exterior, worn-out frame.
<p>-The locking mechanism appears to still work and continues to be used to keep the gate in place.</p>
<p>-The gate is too wide to shut at a straight angle.</p>
<p>-Graffiti marks are apparent at the other side of the gate.</p>

<h3>3. Blanked-Out Crosswalk Sign</h3>

<p>- At one end of the crosswalk, a button with a faded-out sign is found.</p>
<p>-The message of the sign for the button is incomplete with only a piece of an arrow symbol remaining.</p>
<p>-Traces of what may have been a sticker remain over the missing portion of the sign.</p>
<p>-The button and sign are made of metal and are undamaged despite the tampering.</p>

<h3>4. Edited Gas Station Sign</h3>

<p>- A sign announcing the prices of gas and methods of pay are found on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>-The word “DEBIT” has been added onto the sign with the letter T placed outside of the actual sign and over the frame.</p>
<p>-The sign itself is dented in certain areas.</p>
<p>-Due to the dents, the text in some places is warped and distorted.</p>
